                                Despicable Me's mischievous characters enhance and strengthen its heartwarming family-focused story.
                                <br><br>
                                Despicable Me completely took me by surprise! Steve Carrell leads this heartwarmingly delightful, funny film with a fresh premise different from other kid's movies, hilariously lovable characters, and superb execution. Being one of my three-year-old's favorites, I have seen this movie 100 times, and it doesn't get old. Cartel's voice acting is as entertaining as possible, and the Minions are just a masterstroke of brilliance that my daughter exclaims, "it's so cute!" every time they're on the TV. But this animated heist film becomes much more as three orphaned girls warm the heart of criminal mastermind Gru as he grows from an evil loner to a caring father. Despicable Me was as touching as hilarious, and its creativity and fantastic characters make it my absolute favorite animated film of all time.

                            The 2nd Despicable Me movie was amazing! There were almost no flaws when it came to the production of this film! Gru is no longer a villain which defeats the purpose of him being called "despicable." I do love this movies villain more than the first one's. El Macho is better than Vector in my opinion. I like his approach to defeating Gru a little more because A, he teamed up with Doctor Nefario, and B, he kidnapped almost all of Gru's minions and mutated them. Thankfully some of Gru's minions survived so he could break into El Macho's base. I also find it interesting that El Macho's son Antonio, fell in love with Margo. The part at the beginning when Gru's wife Lucy kidnapped him by tasing him and bringing him to the A.V.L. El Macho even mutated towards the end of the movie and kidnapped Lucy, so Gru has to risk his life to defeat his enemy and save his family. Gru and Lucy even had a close call to death when they rode the rocket that nearly landed in an active volcano, the same way El Mach faked his death to trick everyone! This movie is a masterpiece, and it 100% improved over the original film!

                                The mischievous Minions hope that Gru will return to a life of crime after the new boss of the Anti-Villain League fires him. Instead, Gru decides to remain retired and travel to Freedonia to meet his long-lost twin brother for the first time. The reunited siblings soon find themselves in an uneasy alliance to take down the elusive Balthazar Bratt, a former 1980s child star who seeks revenge against the world.

                                A beautiful instant cinema classic, spawned of an angel. The comedy is advanced and intellectual, like when Gru hangs naked in bubblegum. The villain has a perfectly rounded character arc, and the way it depicts the relationship between Gru and Dru just brings a tear to my eye. The true depth is incomprehensible to mortal minds, and that's why the reviews are negative. You need an IQ of at least 100001 to grasp this movie, or else you will dislike it. I, personally have ascended to a godly plane after viewing the emoji movie 612 times. 11/10 best anime, would view another 7879076 times.
